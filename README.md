# worktimers

## Fill out the things.html file with your to do list if you want
### Also fill out the extra stuff you want to have in messages
## Fill out the things.js file to generate the pages
## Add a different audio file because I guarantee you'll get pissed off at this sound
## Quick start, just use sunny_thingss.html and modify the todo list, and just change the other files as you want so they display the right messages
## All the times you're gonna see in the js files are in milliseconds, so 1000 = 1 sec, 60,000 = 1 min
### Note that the default time is 10 minutes for each reminder, but at 30 minutes, a 15 minute timer starts on a new page for a break. This doesn't stop the other timer thouggh, so 10 minutes through the break, you'll get the next reminder.
